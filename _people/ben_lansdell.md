My [Homepage](http://benlansdell.github.io/), and [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vM_KsrQAAAAJ&hl=en) page.

I am interested in developing tools for causal inference in neuroscience, and in understanding how we and/or neural networks can solve causal learning problems. This is a broad project, and involves things like connectivity inference when stimulation data (interventions) are available, connections between reinforcement learning and causal inference, and viewing credit assignment in neural networks as a causal inference problem.
